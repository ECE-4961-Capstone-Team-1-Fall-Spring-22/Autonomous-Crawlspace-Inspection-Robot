#Moisture Probe MCU
• The Raspberry Pi will trigger the Arduino nano through a GPIO pin
• The nano will extend the arm until the proximity sensor triggers
• The nano will extend the linear actuator
• Resistance measurements will be taken through ADC
o R1 will be the first active voltage divider resistor
o If the reading is too small R2 will be turned on instead
o The process will continue through all 5 resistors
o If an edge case is found it will be tested on both sides
• Linear actuator will be lowered
• Arm will be lowered
• Recorded data will be averaged and sent to Raspberry Pi through SPI
#Humidity MCU
• The Raspberry Pi will trigger the Arduino micro through a GPIO pin
• The Arduino will record sensor data through I2C for a second
• Recorded data will be averaged and sent to Raspberry Pi through SPI
#Temperature MCU
• The Raspberry Pi will trigger the Arduino micro through a GPIO pin
• The Arduino will record sensor data through I2C for a second
• Recorded data will be averaged and sent to Raspberry Pi through SPI
