### Temperature
The sensor was place in different areas with different temperatures and the results were compared to a commercial temperature gauge.

### Moisture Content
The Moisture Probe was first tested using axial resistors so that a know value could be tested. The resistors were also checked on a multimeter so that the true value could be compared along with the listed value.

The system was used on blocks of wood with differing moisture contents and compared to the results given by a commercial wood moisture probe.
