# Autonomous-Crawlspace-Inspection-Robot
Tennessee Tech ECE 4961 Capstone Project Autonomous Crawlspace Inspection Robot

## Autonomous-Crawlspace-Inspection-Robot-Capstone-Team-1

# Goals and Aspirations of The Project: 

Crawl spaces grant convenient access to the plumbing, duct
work, and electrical wiring of a house, but they often present
unique dangers to maintenance professionals and residents
alike, such as exposure to harsh breathing conditions and hanging obstacles. Areas that are incredibly difficult for humans to
reach can also present challenges for inspectors. This capstone
project will focus on the design and assembly of a robot
prototype that can perform these inspections autonomously
while also providing sensor data to operators and homeowners.
The end product will be an autonomous vehicle that is
capable of traversing crawl spaces and recording conditions
for operators and residents to review. An inspector will be able
to drop the robot off at a clientâ€™s house and leave it there to
collect the data freeing the operator up to work on other tasks.
While navigating under the house, the robot will be constantly
taking temperature and humidity data which allows users to
see exactly what areas of the space will be prone to mold
growth. A moisture probe will also be included to measure
the moisture content of wooden beams found in a crawlspace.
Members of the inspection industry stand to benefit greatly
from this new product through its efficiency and convenience.
Having a robot that can record inspection data without an
operator present allows the time of company personnel to be
spent on more important tasks. It also allows multiple people
to look at the same data instead of only the people who went
under the house seeing the information. An increased level
of convenience is also provided. Not only is the operator no
longer required to squeeze into a tight crawlspace, but the
robot will also save all acquired data for the user to access
at any time. In future iterations, a 3-dimensional model of the
space will be created as well to create even more convenience.
Inspectors stand to benefit greatly from the development of this
robot.
The scope of the first iteration will include the ability to
autonomously navigate through a simplistic crawl space with
only a few obstacles present, collecting sensor data at certain
intervals, and taking pictures that cover the majority of the
crawl space perimeter. To prepare for future improvements
the robot will also be outfitted with a receiver for manual
control, although this may not be programmed within the
time period. The sensor subsystem will be built with full
modularity so that future iterations can replace the module
with better sensors or new types of sensors. Other future
improvements include continually improving autonomy and
the ability to create a gradient of sensor data. The objective of
this capstone project is to design a robot that will utilize optical
and physical sensors that measure distance in order to navigate
throughout a crawlspace environment, while simultaneously
recording different environmental measurements including:
humidity, temperature, and wood moisture levels.
