# Mechanical Movement System
The mechanical moement subsystem is essential for the operation 
of the Autonomous Crawlspace Inpsection Robot. The main purpose
of this system is to provide the robot with the ability to move.
# Specs, Design, and Analysis: 
This subsystem has a couple specifications that need to be met. 

Firstly, the robot must be able to "roomba around." This 
specification on its own is not enough to fuel a design because 
it is not a quantitative or measurable criteria. In order to
solve this issue, the phrase "roomba around" must be more 
accurately defined. The robot needs to move at approximately 
0.3 meters per second. This speed is fast enough to obtain 
quality measurements and adhere to the sensors' sampling rates, 
but slow enough so that the robot does not outrun the operators 
that would oversee it.The robot should also be able to cover a 
25 square foot area in under an hour. This confirms that the 
robot will have enough battery power to sustain longer operating 
times. In short the robot needs to move at 0.3 m/s

Next up is load. As the structual foundation of the robot the main 
chassis must be able to support all the components that will be on 
the robot. Therefore the weight of the robot is important because 
it has a direct effect on how much torque the motors need to output 
in order to meet the velocity specifcation, and it also affects the 
strength of material that the robot can be made out of as well as 
how the robot is constructed as the robot must be able to support 
its own weight. Therefore, a weight limit of 10kg has been placed on the robot.
