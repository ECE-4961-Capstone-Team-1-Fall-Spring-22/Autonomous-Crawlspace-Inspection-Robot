# Mechanical Movement System
The mechanical moement subsystem is essential for the operation 
of the Autonomous Crawlspace Inpsection Robot. 
# Specs, Design, and Analysis: 
This subsystem has several specifications that need to be met. 
Firstly, the robot must be able to "roomba around." This 
specification on its own is not enough to fuel a design because 
it is not a quantitative or measurable criteria. In order to
solve this issue, the phrase "roomba around" must be more 
accurately defined.

The robot needs to move at approximately 0.3 meters per second. 
This speed is fast enough to obtain quality measurements and 
obtain to the sensors' sampling rates, but slow enough so that 
the robot does not outrun the operators that would oversee it.
The robot should also be able to cover a 25 square foot area in 
under an hour. This confirms that the robot will have enough 
battery power to sustain longer operating times.
