The plan for the software in the mechanical movement subsystem is as follows:

The Arduino Nano Every will receive input from the Raspberry Pi 4 in the Nav subsystem via Serial Communication in the micro USB port on the Arduino.
The information delivered will be instructions on which way the robot needs to go.
The arduino will interpret those instructions and then deliver the directions to the L298N motor controller.
The arduino will use PWM to set the speed of the motors.
The arduino will receive input from the hall sensors on the motors in order to provide an error detection system for the drive train.
That error detection adheres to the strategies identified after the FMEA video was made, which arose from the recommendation of Mr. Roberts
